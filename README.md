# OTP_python

This is the implementation of the OTP scheme introduced in the paper:
"Trajectory Planning Integrated with Risk-aware Corridors: An Optimization-based Approach for Autonomous Vehicles in Uncertain Environments". 

By author: Zheng Li.

Demos can be found in the fold './demo/'.
The processed datasets can be downloaded from: 
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_dDB6MG-g9R0AhIzgHTRPg?pwd=qlrv (Code: qlrv).

Put the fold 'i80' in the path './resources/datasets/ngsim/'.

Run 'main.py' to test the planning performance of different methods and the results will be saved.
Run 'replay_results.py' can replay the result with a visualization GUI.
